2. Set root directory to `client/`
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist/`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
   VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
   ```

A `vercel.json` is already present in `/client` configured for SPA routing rewrites.
